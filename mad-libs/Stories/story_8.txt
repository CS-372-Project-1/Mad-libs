Parts of a Computer
Computers are really { Adjective }! They are made out of { Building Material }. Inside, they have { Type of Food (Plural) }, which run { Noun (Plural) }. To type on, there is a { Noun }board, which sends input to the { Acronym }. Sometimes, there is even a(n) { Animal } to move around and { Verb }! Output gets sent to the screen, which is made of many { Noun (Plural) }. Only 3 colors get combined to make other colors: { Color }, { Color }, and { Color }. Computers really are { Adjective } pieces of engineering!
