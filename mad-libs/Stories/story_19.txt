My Favorite Things
What do I like? I love { Adverb } { Verb Ending in -Ing }. It is very { Adjective } on a hot day. Also, I like { Noun (Plural) }. I donâ€™t really have a reason. Outside, I like to { Verb } or { Verb }. Finally, I really like playing { Noun } music with my { Part of the Body }. These are just a few of my { Adjective } things!
