Halloween Costumes

This year for Halloween, my friends and I all dressed up in { Adjective } costumes. I was the superhero { Adjective } { Noun } and my friend { Name } was my sidekick, { Noun }-Person! Another friend was { Name } from the movie “{ Verb Ending in -Ing } in the { Place }”, which was a(n) { Adjective } hit at my party. Finally, my friend { Name } was a sexy { Profession }, which was { Adjective }, to say the least.
