Snow Days

When I was young, we used to get days off of school whenever it { Verb (Past Tense) } { Adverb }. On those days, I would go to { Place } and { Verb }. Sometimes, I would even { Verb }!. It was always { Adjective } when it { Verb (Past Tense) }, so we would have to wear lots of { Article of Clothing (Plural) } to keep ourselves { Adjective }. I miss snow days!
