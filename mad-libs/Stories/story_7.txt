In the Jungle
In the jungle, you can { Verb } many things. There are { Adjective } { Noun (Plural) }, and also several types of { General Object (Plural) }. As for animals, there are the { Adjective } monkeys, which { Adverb } { Verb }; the { Adjective } tigers, which are { Adjective }; and the elephants, which are my favorite. Why elephants? Well, because they { Verb }, of course!
