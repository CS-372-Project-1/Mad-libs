My Opinion About Grass
{ Noun } is { Adjective }! It is really { Adjective } and nice to { Verb } on! It also helps the { Noun } by being a { General Object }. { Noun } is one of my favorite things, and if it didn’t exist, I would be so { Emotion }. My friend { Name } thinks my opinion is { Adjective }, but I don’t care! I really love { Noun (Plural) }!
